# Solutions for "Cracking the coding interview" problems

## Description
Coded solutions for problems from "Cracking the coding interview",
4 edition book. The solutions are implemented in C++.

For some problems several different solutions are given.

For some problems no solution is given at all (because I got bored
at some point of solving the tasks :))

Along with code for each task come project files generated by
Codeblocks IDE. If you don't use Codeblocks, just take the pure
code - normally a single ```*.cpp``` file - and build it in your
preferred way.
